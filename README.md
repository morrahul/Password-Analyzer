# Password-Analyzer

🚀 Password Security Analyzer in Python 🔐

I’ve been working on a Password Strength Analyzer using Python that evaluates the strength of a password based on several criteria:

✅ Length: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long. ✅ Character Variety: Checks for uppercase, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. ✅ Common Patterns: Flags repeated sequences or common passwords like "password123". ✅ Strength Evaluation: Rates the password as Weak, Medium, or Strong with customized recommendations.

This project uses the re module for pattern matching and colorama for output styling, making the feedback more intuitive.
